I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Kamijo Lab](<http://kmj.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/e_index.html>), Graduate School of [Information Science and Technology](https://www.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index_e.shtml), supervised by [Prof. Shunsuke Kamijo](https://www.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/research/staff/shunsuke-kamijo/). I am working on DeepLearning based generation model for cross-modal mapping, e.g., gestures and audio.

I received my M.E. from <a href="https://www.waseda.jp/top/en/">Waseda Universiy</a>, supervised by <a href="http://www.waseda.jp/sem-ikenaga/content/ikenaga/ikenaga-E.htm">Prof. Takeshi Ikenaga</a>, in 2020,  and B.E. from <a href="https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/">Southeast Universiy</a>, in 2019.

My research interests include Generation Model, Cross-Modal Mapping, Human Pose and Gestures, Audio Signal Processing.
